<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project
![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

AbleToTrack is an time management tool that can help a team become more organized,
efficient, and get more things done. It is a lightweight application that helps to keep track of how
employees or freelancers spend time. Users can enable tracking for their own projects or for
projects to which they are invited by other team members.

<!--Basic time tracking can be done using the web app, but it is highly recommended to download
the desktop application to enable activity level tracking, activity descriptions, screenshots, or
webcam shots.-->

The app tracks the time spent on each task, and records when there is any keyboard or mouse
clicks so that it can enter “idle” automatically when the user are gone and provide insight into
basic activity stats. Note that it will never record anything the user type or click on. The app can
also record screenshots or webcam shots if the user chooses to enable it.
